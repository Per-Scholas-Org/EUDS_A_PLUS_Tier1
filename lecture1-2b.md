## CORE 1 EXAM OBJECTIVES
Understanding the power requirements of all the components and the maximum power output is crucial in managing new builds, upgrades, and repairs. Along with power, all PC components generate heat. Managing heat by installing and maintaining cooling systems makes for a more reliable computing environment. A computer that runs too hot risks damaging its own components and is likely to run at reduced performance levels.
