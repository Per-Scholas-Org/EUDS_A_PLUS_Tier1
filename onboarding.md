Use this programâ€™s learning experience to build a solid foundation in the field of Technology, but also explore the resources outside the platform to complement what you learn in this program, e.g. reading and following quality blogs and websites.

# Succeeding
Since this is a rigorous Certification Program, you will have to go the extra mile to get a good grasp of all the concepts and their applications. So it is extremely important that you plan your study week properly. 
 
The learning experience consists of two broad elements â€” **asynchronous activities** which can be performed at your own convenience and **synchronous activities** like live lectures which take place at a set time and day.

***So the key takeaways are as follows:***

Make sure to commit at least **7-9 hours per day** to the program. This commitment might vary for you depending on your pace of learning. We will also be there to help you plan your activities and make sure that you achieve all the set targets.

Here at Per Scholas, we have designed a strong system for you to help you achieve your goals for the program. 
**For any:**

* General Queries and Help with Challenges: Every student has access to a Student Experience specialist who will help you in non-academic program-related challenges, and help you in achieving your learning goals. You can reach out to your Specialist by contacting your instructor.
For general topics that you would like to discuss with your fellow students, the Telegram group is the most suitable medium. We will create the groups and also be monitoring the interactions that occur within them.

* Academic Queries: The discussion forum is the best place to post your academic queries. These questions can then be answered by your fellow students. Our teaching assistants will evaluate these responses and will verify appropriate responses or provide additional ones.

* One important thing to note is that the teaching assistants will not step in and answer any queries for the first 24 hours to give students the opportunity to contribute and assist each other. If no acceptable response has been provided to your question by peers on the forum, only then will the TAs step in and provide a suitable answer within 48-72 hours.

Your road to success will be long and hard, but a fulfilling one. Along your way, you will have to showcase and prove your skills to many stakeholders, including faculty members, peers, mentors, and the outside world. 

In the program, your performance will be evaluated through quiz questions, assignments, projects & Final exams. 

Over the duration of the program, the following activities will go into the calculation of your program score:

* **Quizzes:** In content quizzes are MCQs and numerical based questions. You will receive automatic grades on these MCQs as soon as you attempt them.
* **Assignments:** Assignments are submission-based questions. You will be individually evaluated based on your submissions along with your respective scores.
* **Assessment Components:** Your program percentage score for each course will be computed for every module based on a series of assessments.

| **Type of Assessments**                            |   **Weightage**               |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Quizzes & Assignments (Graded questions)           |       	40%                    |
| Case Studies, Live Projects, and End Exams         |      	60%                    |

To get the Google IT Certificate, you have to complete all the required course work with an overall percentage of 75%. You are strongly recommended to put in the effort to make sure that you meet these criteria.

* All the deadlines are non-negotiable
* If you submit the assignments or quizzes after the deadline, but before one week after the deadline, you will be graded on 80% of the original marks (you will incur a 20% penalty).
* If you delay your assignments or quizzes beyond one week after the original deadline, the same will not be graded

For all the modules and for the course overall, the following table shows the grade corresponding to score range.
