#### RECERTIFICATION
*Your CompTIA A+ certification is good for three years from the day of your exam.
You can participate in a number of activities and training programs, including higher certifications, to renew your CompTIA A+ certification. Collect at least 20 Continuing Education Units (CEUs) in three years, upload them to your certification account, and A+ will automatically renew.*

### High Level Unit Overview

| Module   | Ultimate Goal   | Class Days |
| :------  | :---------- | :------:  |
| **Pre-Work: Desktop & Networking Admin and Support Fundamentals** | Self-paced learning in the PS Academy to be completed before the beginning of class. Topics include computer hardware basics, understanding operating systems and their purpose, software, and IT career opportunities. Learners will also be instructed on navigating CANVAS, Per Scholas Policies, and provided resources with support.      <br /><br /> Each learner should receive Per Scholas laptop ad Resource Kit with equipment, software, and tools necessary to complete this program.     <br /><br /> Please note: This is a two-part program to support CompTIA’s A+ Core 1 (220-1101) and Core 2 (220-1102) Exams which make up the A+ Certification (learners must pass both parts to receive the A+ Cert).     <br /><br /> CompTIA A+ 220-1101 covers mobile devices, networking technology, hardware, virtualization and cloud computing.    <br /><br /> CompTIA A+ 220-1102 covers operating systems, security, software and operational procedures.    <br /><br /> In addition to fulfilling the requirements of passing the two CompTIA A+ Certifications, learners will be expected to demonstrate their understanding and application of designing and developing an efficient and effective Help Desk, including the various Tiers and escalation processes.   |  5 |
| **CORE 1: 220-1101**  | **Five Domains make up CORE 1, 220-1101**    <br /> Domain 1: Mobile Devices (15%)    <br /> Domain 2: Networking (20%)    <br /> Domain 3: Hardware (25%)    <br /> Domain 4: Virtualization and Cloud Computing (11%)    <br /> Domain 5: Hardware and Network Troubleshooting (29%) | |
| **Hardware Components & Virtualization and Cloud Computing** | Here is where learners begin their journey into the Desktop & Network Admin and Support program. Best practices for understanding what it takes to become a Desktop and Network Support Technician starts with understanding the components of computers, networking devices, and configuring these environments to meet the growing needs of the organization. The focus here is on hardware first and then introducing learners to Virtualization, which starts at the hardware level, and how Cloud Computing plays a critical role in developing remote virtual environments as well as establishing secondary storage and co-location opportunities.    <br /><br /> ***Deliverables for the completion of this section include and not limited to building a gaming personal computer (PC) from the ground up, install and configure a Virtual Server and creating a Linux Virtual Server, demonstrating Linux commands and successful navigation on the gaming PC; and configuring/deploying a Virtual Desktop within a Cloud Service Provider environment for testing purposes.***  |   7  |
| **Networking**  | Learners will deep dive into networking concepts, architecture, and devices spanning from understanding the seven layers of OSI model, topologies, in-depth knowledge and insights on IPv4 vs IPv6, DNS, DHCP, and TCP vs UDP as well as diving into subnetting, connecting devices, and the various Wi-Fi standards, types, their origins, the security features they offer and other frequency, signal modulation and integrating an efficient Wi-Fi.    <br /><br /> ***Deliverables for the completion of this section include and not limited to designing and developing a secure WAN for a medium sized Manufacturing company (illustrations to be presented - documented using illustration tool of choice), and deploy a department level LAN for the same company to be presented using the equipment and tools provided (router, switch, cabling kit, punchdown tools, punchdown block).***  |  7  |
| **Mobile Devices**  | The topic of Mobile Devices is covered by domain 1, probably because they are the most personal information technology devices that are integrated within our daily lives and always on your person or in your hand. The focus of this domain has evolved from the previous versions of CompTIA’s A+ exams; the sub-objectives have been reduced from seven to four. In addition, the focus has shifted to be more security-minded; such as, port configuration and to involve newer technologies such as touch screen displays.    <br /><br /> ***Deliverables for the completion of this section include and are not limited to identifying and presenting appropriate port configurations that support mobile devices (what is recommended to support and secure the wireless, mobile devices used at the same medium sized Manufacturing company identified in the Networking section?); and identifying and presenting typical mobile devices being used within this organization and how to protect the company’s assets.*** |  3  |
| **Printers & Multifunction Devices**  | Learners will discover key concepts, learn how to setup/configure multifunction devices (MFDs) including proper unboxing and setup location considerations. They will also learn how to recognize appropriate drivers needed for a given Operating System (OS) such as Printer Control Language (PCL) and PostScript; differentiate between USB, Ethernet, and wireless device connectivity options; and outline how to properly install and replace impact printer consumables, 3-D printers, and other MFDs to include setting up email, SMB, and cloud services for MFDs.    <br /><br /> ***Deliverables for the completion of this section include and not limited to identifying and presenting potential MFD challenges facing the Manufacturing company and how to mitigate the potential challenges (what do you do if the problem occurs?).***  |  #   |
| **Troubleshooting**   | When hardware and networks work well, it is wonderful; however, it is not always the case and as an IT support professional, you will be depended upon to fix whatever goes wrong. Any device or network issue will fall within your domain, which is why hardware and network troubleshooting is the most emphasized area on the CompTIA A+ 1101 test with 29%, nearly one-third of the questions pertaining to it. It is important to note that ALL the questions about hardware and network troubleshooting will begin with a scenario.    <br /><br /> During this session, learners will  understand the best practice methodology which refers to the basic, structured principles that should be followed when approaching a troubleshooting situation.     <br /><br /> ***Deliverables for the completion of this section include and not limited to resolving one of the Case Challenges (the Manufacturing company is having problems within their hardware, software, networking, printing, etc. that need IT Support attention) to demonstrate clear understanding of the troubleshooting steps, analysis, planning, testing, implementing, and post-implementation requirements of troubleshooting, and recommended solution(s).***    | 5  |
|  **Review / Project / Exam**   | During this session, learners will review all material, assignments, take practice tests, and work on the Capstone Project (Designing and Developing an Efficient Help Desk to be presented at the end of this 14-week course).    <br /><br /> ***Deliverables for the completion of this section include and are not limited to completing lectures, labs, and preparing for CompTIA A+ 220-1101 Exam (to be scheduled and passed by end of week). For Learners who do not pass the 220-1101 Exam, you will need to arrange additional tutoring/study time (to be determined by your Manager).***  |   5   |
