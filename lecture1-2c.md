The fixed disk provides persistent storage when the computer is turned off, but a PC also requires fast random access memory (RAM) to load applications and files. Adding system RAM is one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to increase a computer's performance, but there are many types of RAM and ways of configuring the memory subsystem that you must be able to choose between for given scenarios.

Includes:
* System RAM and Virtual Memory
* RAM Types
* Memory Modules
