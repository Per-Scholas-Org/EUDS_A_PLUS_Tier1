# Hardware Components & Virtualization and Cloud Computing
Here is where learners begin their journey into the Desktop & Network Admin and Support program. Best practices for understanding what it takes to become a Desktop and Network Support Technician starts with understanding the components of computers, networking devices, and configuring these environments to meet the growing needs of the organization. The focus here is on hardware first and then introducing learners to Virtualization, which starts at the hardware level, and how Cloud Computing plays a critical role in developing remote virtual environments as well as establishing secondary storage and co-location opportunities.

Deliverables for the completion of this section include and not limited to building a gaming personal computer (PC) from the ground up, install and configure a Virtual Server and creating a Linux Virtual Server, demonstrating Linux commands and successful navigation on the gaming PC; and configuring/deploying a Virtual Desktop within a Cloud Service Provider environment for testing purposes.
