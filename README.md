In addition, learners will be able to design, develop, and implement the organization‚Äôs infrastructure (Case Challenge TestOut) based on the organization‚Äôs needs, resources, and budget, as well as present network design (Illustrations) that identify the recommended solutions for the organization.

## Module 3: Mobile Devices
Mobile devices have become completely integrated within our environments and a part of our daily lives, which is why CompTIA highlights this category in their premiere domain. Learners will be able to troubleshoot several issues that occur with mobile devices and identify fixes, repairs, or replacement options to remedy the situation. Learner will also be able to install, configure, and troubleshoot laptops, configure accessories and ports of mobile devices, and develop a solution for the TestOut Case Challenge to demonstrate their understanding of content shared, instructions provided, and pass practice exams that support CompTIA‚Äôs 220-1101 domain 1 section.

## Module 4: Printers & Multifunction Devices (MDFs)
Printer and Multifunction Devices (MDFs) have always been a challenge for IT Support professionals. Sometimes the troubleshooting efforts are simple, which IT Support professionals appreciate; however, there are far too many issues that transpire with printers and MDFs and most IT Support Professionals find these devices to be their least favorite with troubleshooting and fixing. Through this section, you will learn the techniques and best practices of identifying the problem(s), analyzing the situation, developing the solution, creating the plan to test and deploy the solution, implement the solution, and follow-up to ensure the issue is resolved. Learners will be able to understand and demonstrate the most appropriate action plan for the TestOut Case Challenge and pass the practice exams for this section.

## Module 5: Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting has been identified as a form of art and science combined, bringing the IT Support professional‚Äôs creative through process with analytical capabilities to identify the root cause of the problem, analyze options to mitigate the issue, devise a strategic plan to correct/fix the problem, and demonstrate techniques for correcting the problem and formulating recommendations to prevent future issues. Learners will demonstrate best practices for resolving an organization‚Äôs issue based on the TestOut Case Challenge and successfully passing the practice exams for this section.

## Module 6: Review CORE 1 - Review & Exam
The focus for learners is to review content, instructional guides, complete practice exams, study for the A+ 220-1101 exam and pass by the week‚Äôs end.

**NOTE:** *For those learners who are still struggling and needing additional support, there will be a Tutoring session established to ensure appropriate support is provided to successfully pass the exam. There is an additional week included within this program to support learners needing to retake this exam.* 

# CORE 2 - 220-1102 (A+)
The following Modules summarize the learning objectives, content, assignments, and TestOut deliverables.

## Module 1: Operating Systems (OSs) / Network Operating Systems (NOSs)
Defined as system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. 

There are several OSs, NOSs, and Wireless OSs in existence today. Here is a list of the main ones:
**Operating Systems (OSs)** 
* Microsoft Windows 10 (Home, Pro, Enterprise)
* Microsoft Windows 11 (Home, Pro, Pro for Workstations, Enterprise)
* Apple MacOS 13 - Ventura
* Apple MacOS 14 - Sonoma

* Other embedded systems to be discussed

## Module 2: Security
There are several ways to keep an organization‚Äôs assets safe and secure:
* Physically
* Technically
* Operationally

Learners will be able to identify security vulnerabilities within the organization‚Äôs infrastructure, policies, and daily operations. This is imperative for an organization to remain safe, secure, and compliant as well as ensuring the learner understands security best practices and how to identify risks and implement mitigation strategies.

## Module 3: Software Troubleshooting
Software troubleshooting is complex and requires patience in addition to full understanding of the process of identifying the root cause, analyzing the situation, planning corrective actions, creating a backout plan (may be needed if the solution fails), and implementation plan to execute with lessons learned to be followed up with the organization or group affected by the software issue(s).

Learners will be able to demonstrate their understanding of the troubleshooting process, demonstrate the knowledge obtained and retained by successfully completing the TestOut Case Challenge and passing the practice exams.

## Module 4: Operational Procedures
It is imperative organizations establish operational procedures to ensure their assets are accessible by the correct individuals, protected from bad actors, backed up with back-ups checked and tested, staff properly trained to avoid potential breaches or lost data, and policies, processes, and procedures documented, tested, reviewed, and updated accordingly.

Learners will be able to create appropriate policies, processes, and procedures appropriate to an organization‚Äôs requirements by successfully completing the TestOut Case Challenge and passing the practice exams.

## Module 5: Review CORE 2  Exam & Project
The focus for learners is to review content, instructional guides, complete practice exams, study for the A+ 220-1102 exam and pass by the week‚Äôs end.

There is an extra week added to ensure Learners will be able to complete their Capstone Project to present to organizational partners (Executives) the day before graduation, per Capstone requirements.

**NOTE:** *For those learners who are still struggling and needing additional support, there will be a Tutoring session established to ensure appropriate support is provided to successfully pass the exam. There is an additional week included within this program to support learners needing to retake this exam.* 


# CAREER SERVICES 

## TECHNICAL INTERVIEW & RESUME PREPARATION 
Week 14 places special emphasis on interview preparation ‚Äì interview preparation, whiteboarding and resume/portfolio development. Learners will have multiple mock technical and conversational interviews as preparation for hiring. 

## COMMUNICATIONS - Listening, Writing, Presenting 
Typically, much of Desktop & Networking Admin and Support functions rely on the IT Support person‚Äôs ability to communicate, which includes listening to the customer (What is the problem or issue?), document the problem or issue within the Help Desk Ticketing System to include specific details of the issue. The details captured must be legible because if this issue were to be escalated to another Tier, that IT Support person would need to review the documentation of the initial IT Support person and that is something the newly assigned IT Support person relies on. If the documentation is poorly written and unclear, that recently assigned IT Support person will not have a clear understanding of the problem and will be forced to contact the customer in order to provide the correct fix. This wastes time, which ends up costing the company unnecessary financial loss.

Another aspect of communications within the form of requirements gathering and documentation is Illustration/Flowcharting; learners will be introduced to Flowcharting, Process Mapping, Data Mapping, and Mind Mapping techniques per TestOut Case Challenges. This is an important skill to learn and master; most organizations rely on proper documentation and especially prevalent in Cybersecurity. Data mapping, process flows, and infrastructure illustrations help the Cybersecurity Analyst and professional understand the implemented infrastructure and processes of the organization, which provide them a baseline of where to begin their search. If there are gaps between the documentation and the actual infrastructure and operational procedures, it is the duty of the Cybersecurity Analyst/Professional to create a gap analysis and report on these findings. In addition, the analyst would work with the organization‚Äôs Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the Internal Auditing department to devise a strategic plan to fix those gaps and ensure the organization remains secure and compliant.

## POST-GRADUATION 
The support continues after Instructors complete their course, pass the Certification Exam, and present their final Capstone project. Learners have the opportunity to request additional career guidance and upskilling to assist them in obtaining self-sustaining jobs/positions within IT.
