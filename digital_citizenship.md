# What is Netiquette?...
With the onset of the online education environment and the expansion of online courses, there is a fancy buzzword floating around called **netiquette**. Simply defined, it means etiquette on the Internet (or net). Using Canvas, you will be speaking through writing both to your classmates and to your teachers. Oh... and did we mention that your parents can see it also! So , it is imperative to communicate well and professionally.

## The Golden Rule of Netiquette
Be prepared to communicate effectively when using Canvas in your classes. Following these simple guidelines will ensure your success!  Remember when speaking in Canvas or in any online environment for that matter, the same rules apply for etiquette as in real-life!

***The golden rule of netiquette in an online class or environment is, do not do or say online what you would not do or say offline.***


### Let's look at the 5 most important netiquette rules for use in Canvas or for any online environment.


1. Be Friendly, Positive and Self-Reflective       ![Image of a group of friends](https://github.com/Per-Scholas-Org/EUDS_A_PLUS_Tier1/blob/assets/friends1.jpg)


When people cannot see you, and also do not know you, feelings can be hurt if you are not careful in how you express yourself. The old saying, think before you speak is important here. ***Think before you send!*** Always re-read what you have written. Don't send anything in writing that you wouldn't feel comfortable saying to someone in person. Also, be sure that your words can't easily be misinterpreted. It is helpful to speak your response out-loud. ***Proofread everything!***

2. **Use Proper Language & Be Respectful**

Do not use slang or even profane words in an online education environment, even if they are words you consider, "not so bad," as they will sound offensive to the reader. Even though your intent may to be funny, it might not come across that way.  Also, DO NOT use caps lock when typing. It will insinuate yelling. That would hurt someone's feelings and possibly give him (or her) the wrong impression of you. Remember, you may be faced with the challenge of disagreeing with a peer's view point. While you have the right to disagree, do so with respect. 

3. **Use Effective Communication** ![Image indicating to not use emojis.](https://github.com/Per-Scholas-Org/EUDS_A_PLUS_Tier1/blob/assets/lol%20no.png)

Say what you mean to say. This takes practice and thoughtful writing. Try to speak and write clearly at all times. Again, reread before you respond. Define and restate your words when necessary. Correct a misunderstanding right away. Chances are, if one person felt a certain way about what you said, another may have as well. Likewise, be mindful of chosen words and joking. Let's say for example, I write, "get out!" This slang term can be interpreted in several ways, either positively or negatively. Leave the sarcasm and and instant message abbreviations out. (LOL!)

*HOWEVER; You can use **"emojis"** or **faces** using (the *comma + colon*) to express emotions, because they do have a valid purpose in online communication!  They help the reader understand your emotion! People see only what you have written, there is little opportunity to explain further or to use non verbal ques. 

 

AND lastly, always say please and thank you!
